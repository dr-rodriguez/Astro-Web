We want to create a dynamic website (and API) to explore our astronomical database of brown dwarfs. We want to use FastAPI with Jinja2 templates as backend/frontend. Our database is a SQLite file where we will use Astrodbkit to access and explore. We want to use Bokeh for any visualizations. This website is meant to be a prototype for other astronomical databases and developed by astronomers with intermediate-level python skills. Keep coding logic simple to facilitate future upgrades.
