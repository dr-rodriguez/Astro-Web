# Feature Specification: Display Sources Data

**Feature Branch**: `002-display-sources-data`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Let's start out database logic using astrodbkit and the file SIMPLE.sqlite. We want to display the first 10 rows of the Sources table in the front page for now. We will sort out other tables and pages later."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: How should astronomical coordinates (ra, dec) be displayed? → A: Raw database values with full precision as stored
- Q: What should users see while data is loading? → A: Empty white space (data appears when ready, no placeholder)
- Q: What error message should be shown when the database is unavailable? → A: Hide the table and show only a sentence in the content area

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Sources Data on Front Page (Priority: P1)

When users visit the homepage, they see a table displaying the first 10 astronomical sources from the SIMPLE.sqlite database. This provides immediate visibility into the data the application is built upon.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational user experience for data display. It validates the database connection works and provides immediate value by showing real data. Without this, users cannot see any actual database content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the homepage and verifying that a table with 10 rows from the Sources table is displayed correctly with all columns visible. This delivers value by proving the database integration is functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the web server is running with the SIMPLE.sqlite database accessible, **When** a user visits the homepage, **Then** a table displays exactly 10 rows from the Sources table with all available columns (source, ra, dec, epoch, equinox, shortname, reference, other_references, comments)
2. **Given** the Sources table contains data, **When** a user views the homepage, **Then** the displayed rows match the first 10 rows in the database (in database order)
3. **Given** the web server is running, **When** a user views the homepage, **Then** the page loads and displays the sources table within 3 seconds

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the SIMPLE.sqlite database file is missing? The table is hidden and a simple sentence is displayed in the content area (e.g., "Sources data could not be loaded at this time.")
- How does the system handle if the Sources table has fewer than 10 rows? The system displays all available rows from the Sources table (up to 10)
- What happens when database connection fails? The table is hidden and a simple error message is displayed in the content area instead
- How does the system handle database file corruption or locked file? The table is hidden and the application displays a message in the content area that data is temporarily unavailable

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to the SIMPLE.sqlite database file and establish a working connection
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve the first 10 rows from the Sources table and display them in tabular format on the homepage in database order
- **FR-003**: System MUST display all columns from the Sources table (source, ra, dec, epoch, equinox, shortname, reference, other_references, comments)
- **FR-004**: System MUST load and display the data within 3 seconds of page load
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle database connection errors gracefully by hiding the table and displaying a simple error message in the content area (e.g., "Sources data could not be loaded at this time.")
- **FR-006**: System MUST display data in a readable tabular format, showing all values at full precision as stored in the database (no rounding or formatting applied)
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the existing homepage structure (header, footer, navigation)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Source**: Represents an astronomical source with attributes including identifier (source), celestial coordinates (ra, dec, epoch, equinox), short name, references, and optional comments
- **Source Table Display**: Represents the presentation of 10 source records in a tabular format on the homepage
- **Database Connection**: Represents the link between the application and SIMPLE.sqlite database file

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the first 10 Sources records on the homepage within 3 seconds of entering the URL
- **SC-002**: The Sources table displays all available columns correctly for all 10 rows
- **SC-003**: Data retrieval completes within 1 second from the moment the page is requested
- **SC-004**: The page renders correctly with the Sources table visible to users without requiring additional interaction
- **SC-005**: When the database is unavailable, the table is hidden and users see a simple error message in the content area within 2 seconds

## Dependencies

- SIMPLE.sqlite database file must exist and be accessible
- Database access capability for SQLite database files
- Existing web server infrastructure (from 001-hello-world-website)
- Database file is in a stable location relative to the application

## Assumptions

- The SIMPLE.sqlite database file contains at least some rows in the Sources table
- The database file structure includes a Sources table with the expected columns
- Users primarily want to see the first 10 rows without sorting or filtering initially
- Displaying data in database order is acceptable (no specific sort order required)
- The Sources table contains the standard columns as defined in the database schema

## Out of Scope

This feature explicitly does NOT include:

- Pagination or navigation to additional rows
- Sorting or filtering capabilities
- Searching within the Sources data
- Displaying other tables (Publications, Parameters, etc.)
- Dedicated pages for different tables
- Editing or modifying the Sources data
- Displaying more than the first 10 rows
- Export functionality for the displayed data
- Responsive table design for mobile devices
- Tooltips or additional details on hover
