# Tasks: Search Page Implementation

**Feature**: Search Page  
**Branch**: `005-search-page`  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This document provides actionable, dependency-ordered tasks for implementing the Search Page feature. Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Each task follows the strict checklist format and includes specific file paths for immediate execution.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Search for Astronomical Objects) provides core functionality  
**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story can be implemented and tested independently  
**Parallel Opportunities**: Template creation, CSS styling, and route implementation can be done in parallel within each story phase

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

### T001-T003: Project Structure and Dependencies

- [ ] T001 Verify astrodbkit ≥2.4 installation and database connection in src/database/sources.py
- [ ] T002 Confirm FastAPI ≥0.120.0 with Jinja2 templates configured in src/main.py
- [ ] T003 Validate JavaScript DataTable CDN accessibility for search results display

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

### T004-T006: Core Infrastructure

- [ ] T004 [P] Add Search link to navigation bar in src/templates/base.html
- [ ] T005 [P] Create search form template structure in src/templates/search.html
- [ ] T006 [P] Create search results template structure in src/templates/search_results.html

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Search for Astronomical Objects (P1)

**Goal**: Enable users to find specific astronomical objects by entering search terms and receiving results in a table format with clickable links to individual source pages.

**Independent Test**: Access Search page, enter search term, verify results returned in table format with clickable links to individual source pages.

### T007-T012: Core Search Functionality

- [ ] T007 [US1] Implement search form route handler in src/routes/web.py
- [ ] T008 [US1] Implement search results route handler with astrodbkit integration in src/routes/web.py
- [ ] T009 [US1] Add client-side form validation for empty search terms in src/templates/search.html
- [ ] T010 [US1] Implement astrodbkit search_object function call in src/routes/web.py
- [ ] T011 [US1] Format search results for template display in src/routes/web.py
- [ ] T012 [US1] Add hyperlinks from search results to individual source inventory pages in src/templates/search_results.html

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Browse Search Results (P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to review multiple search results with key identifying information to make informed decisions about which object to examine in detail.

**Independent Test**: Perform search returning multiple results, verify results table displays sufficient information for users to distinguish between different objects.

### T013-T016: Results Display Enhancement

- [ ] T013 [US2] Implement JavaScript DataTable initialization with vanilla CSS styling in src/templates/search_results.html
- [ ] T014 [US2] Add vanilla CSS styling for search results table (no JavaScript-based styling frameworks) in src/static/style.css
- [ ] T015 [US2] Configure DataTable pagination and sorting options using CSS-only styling in src/templates/search_results.html
- [ ] T016 [US2] Display all source columns (source, ra, dec, epoch, equinox, shortname, reference, other_references, comments) in src/templates/search_results.html

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Handle Empty or No Results (P3)

**Goal**: Provide clear feedback about search outcomes and guide users on next steps when searches return no results or encounter errors.

**Independent Test**: Enter search terms that return no results, verify appropriate messaging is displayed to the user.

### T017-T020: Error Handling and User Feedback

- [ ] T017 [US3] Implement server-side validation for empty search queries in src/routes/web.py
- [ ] T018 [US3] Add "no results found" message display in src/templates/search_results.html
- [ ] T019 [US3] Implement astrodbkit error handling with generic error message in src/routes/web.py
- [ ] T020 [US3] Add "New Search" navigation link in search results template in src/templates/search_results.html

## Phase 6: API Endpoint (Cross-Cutting)

### T021-T022: Programmatic Access

- [ ] T021 [P] Implement programmatic search API endpoint in src/routes/web.py
- [ ] T022 [P] Add API endpoint error handling and response formatting in src/routes/web.py

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### T023-T025: Final Integration and Styling

- [ ] T023 Add comprehensive CSS styling for search form and results in src/static/style.css
- [ ] T024 Implement responsive design for search results table in src/static/style.css
- [ ] T025 Add search execution time display in search results template in src/templates/search_results.html

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
1. **User Story 1** (P1) - Core search functionality must be completed first
2. **User Story 2** (P2) - Results display enhancement depends on User Story 1
3. **User Story 3** (P3) - Error handling can be implemented in parallel with User Story 2

### Task Dependencies
- T004-T006 (Foundational) must complete before User Story phases
- T007-T012 (US1) must complete before T013-T016 (US2)
- T017-T020 (US3) can be implemented in parallel with T013-T016 (US2)
- T021-T022 (API) can be implemented in parallel with User Story phases
- T023-T025 (Polish) should be completed after all user stories

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Within User Story 1 (T007-T012):
- T007, T008, T009 can be implemented in parallel (different files)
- T010, T011 can be implemented in parallel (same file, different functions)
- T012 depends on T007-T011 completion

### Within User Story 2 (T013-T016):
- T013, T014 can be implemented in parallel (different files)
- T015, T016 can be implemented in parallel (same file, different sections)

### Cross-Story Parallel Opportunities:
- T004-T006 (Foundational) can all be implemented in parallel
- T021-T022 (API) can be implemented in parallel with any user story phase
- T017-T020 (US3) can be implemented in parallel with T013-T016 (US2)

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 25
- **User Story 1 Tasks**: 6 (T007-T012)
- **User Story 2 Tasks**: 4 (T013-T016)  
- **User Story 3 Tasks**: 4 (T017-T020)
- **Setup Tasks**: 3 (T001-T003)
- **Foundational Tasks**: 3 (T004-T006)
- **API Tasks**: 2 (T021-T022)
- **Polish Tasks**: 3 (T023-T025)

## Independent Test Criteria

- **User Story 1**: Can access Search page, enter search term, verify results returned in table format with clickable links
- **User Story 2**: Can perform search returning multiple results, verify results table displays sufficient information for object distinction
- **User Story 3**: Can enter search terms returning no results, verify appropriate messaging displayed

## Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Complete User Story 1 (T007-T012) provides core search functionality enabling users to find astronomical objects and navigate to detailed inventory pages. This delivers the essential value proposition while maintaining implementation simplicity.
