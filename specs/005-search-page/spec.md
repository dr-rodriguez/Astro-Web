# Feature Specification: Search Page

**Feature Branch**: `005-search-page`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a Search page in the navigation bar. For now it should have a form to that calls search_object from astrodbkit (see @https://astrodbkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ) and returns a table of results in a separate results page. That table should link to the individual source inventory pages for each row."

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19

- Q: How should search results be paginated when there are many matches? → A: Use JavaScript DataTable for pagination
- Q: Which specific data fields should be shown in the search results table? → A: Source name, RA, Dec, reference, comments
- Q: How should the system handle empty search form submissions? → A: Show validation error message "Please enter a search term"
- Q: How should the system handle astrodbkit search_object function errors? → A: Show generic error message "An error occurred during search"
- Q: How should the system handle potentially malicious search input? → A: Pass input directly to astrodbkit without sanitization

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Search for Astronomical Objects (Priority: P1)

A user wants to find specific astronomical objects in the database by entering search terms. They navigate to the Search page from the navigation bar, enter their search query, and receive a table of matching results that they can browse and click through to view detailed information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables users to discover and access astronomical data. Without search capability, users cannot efficiently find specific objects in the database.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the Search page, entering a search term, and verifying that results are returned in a table format with clickable links to individual source pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the website, **When** they click "Search" in the navigation bar, **Then** they are taken to a Search page with a search form
2. **Given** a user is on the Search page, **When** they enter a search term and submit the form, **Then** they are redirected to a results page showing matching astronomical objects in a table
3. **Given** a user is viewing search results, **When** they click on a row in the results table, **Then** they are taken to the individual source inventory page for that object

### User Story 2 - Browse Search Results (Priority: P2)

A user wants to review multiple search results to find the specific astronomical object they're looking for. They need to see key identifying information for each result to make informed decisions about which object to examine in detail.

**Why this priority**: While search functionality is core, the ability to effectively browse and compare results is essential for user productivity and satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing a search that returns multiple results and verifying that the results table displays sufficient information for users to distinguish between different objects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has performed a search, **When** multiple results are returned, **Then** each row in the results table displays source name, RA, Dec, reference, and comments
2. **Given** a user is viewing search results, **When** they see multiple objects, **Then** they can easily distinguish between different objects based on the displayed source name, coordinates, reference, and comments

---

### User Story 3 - Handle Empty or No Results (Priority: P3)

A user searches for an astronomical object that doesn't exist in the database or enters an invalid search term. The system should provide clear feedback about the search outcome and guide the user on next steps.

**Why this priority**: Error handling and user feedback are important for user experience, but the core search functionality takes precedence.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering search terms that return no results and verifying that appropriate messaging is displayed to the user.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user searches for a term that doesn't match any objects, **When** the search completes, **Then** they see a clear message indicating no results were found
2. **Given** a user enters an invalid search term, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they receive appropriate feedback about the search issue

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the search returns a very large number of results (1000+ objects)? → JavaScript DataTable handles pagination automatically
- How does the system handle special characters or SQL injection attempts in search terms? → Pass input directly to astrodbkit without sanitization
- What happens when the astrodbkit search_object function encounters an error? → Show generic error message "An error occurred during search"
- How does the system behave when users submit empty search forms? → Show validation error message "Please enter a search term"

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Search page accessible from the navigation bar
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a search form with an input field and submit button
- **FR-003**: System MUST call astrodbkit's search_object function when the search form is submitted
- **FR-004**: System MUST display search results in a JavaScript DataTable format on a separate results page with built-in pagination, showing columns for source name, RA, Dec, reference, and comments
- **FR-005**: System MUST make each row in the results table clickable to navigate to individual source inventory pages
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where no search results are found
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve search terms when displaying results
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear navigation back to the search form from results
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate search form input and show error message "Please enter a search term" for empty submissions
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle astrodbkit search_object function errors by showing generic error message "An error occurred during search"

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Search Query**: User input containing astronomical object identifiers, names, or partial matches
- **Search Results**: Collection of astronomical objects returned by astrodbkit search_object function
- **Astronomical Object**: Individual source with identifying information (name, coordinates, etc.) that can be linked to inventory pages

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete a search from navigation to results
- **SC-002**: Search results are displayed after form submission
- **SC-003**: 95% of valid search queries return results successfully
- **SC-004**: Users can navigate from search results to individual source pages in one click
