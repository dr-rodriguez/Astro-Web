# Feature Specification: Navigation Bar with Multi-Page Structure

**Feature Branch**: `003-nav-bar`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Let's make a top navigation bar for our site. The first option, Home, should be the index.html landing page, with brief text about the database. The second option, Browse Database, should include the a table with the full list of Sources. It should have some basic controls like sorting columns, pagination, and filtering. The third option, Plots, should include a Bokeh scatter plot with the ra and dec values from the Sources table."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: Should sorting, filtering, and pagination on Browse Database page be client-side (in browser) or server-side (API calls per interaction)? → A: Client-side - all Sources data loaded once, filtering/sorting/pagination handled by DataTables JavaScript library in browser
- Q: How should filtering work on Browse Database page - single global search or separate filters per column? → A: Single global search box that searches across all columns simultaneously
- Q: Should table sorting support multiple columns simultaneously or single-column only? → A: Single-column only - clicking a different column header clears previous sort and sorts by new column
- Q: Should navigation use separate URLs for each page (/browse, /plots) or single-page app (SPA) style routing? → A: Separate URLs for each page - /browse and /plots are distinct routes with proper browser navigation
- Q: Should sort/filter/pagination state reset when leaving and returning to Browse Database page, or persist? → A: State resets - each visit to Browse Database starts with default settings (all data, first page, no sort/filter applied)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Navigate Between Pages (Priority: P1)

Users can navigate between different sections of the website using a top navigation bar, allowing them to switch between viewing an introduction (Home), browsing all database records (Browse Database), and exploring visual representations of the data (Plots).

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational navigation structure that organizes the application into logical sections. Without this, users cannot efficiently access different views of the database content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking on each navigation link and verifying the corresponding page loads and displays the correct content. This delivers immediate value by organizing the previously mixed homepage content into distinct, focused pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on any page, **When** they click a navigation link, **Then** the corresponding page loads and displays without requiring a full browser refresh
2. **Given** the navigation bar is present on all pages, **When** a user clicks between Home, Browse Database, and Plots, **Then** each page displays the appropriate content (brief intro, data table with controls, scatter plot respectively)
3. **Given** the navigation bar is displayed, **When** the user views it, **Then** it appears at the top of the page and remains visible and accessible across all pages

---

### User Story 2 - View Home Page Introduction (Priority: P2)

Users visit the Home page and see a brief introduction to the astronomical database with key information about what data is available.

**Why this priority**: This provides users with context about the database and sets expectations for what they can explore in other sections.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the Home page and verifying that introductory text about the database is displayed clearly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user navigates to the Home page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a brief text introduction about the database is displayed in the content area
2. **Given** the Home page is displayed, **When** the user reads the introduction, **Then** it provides context about the astronomical sources database and guides them to other sections
3. **Given** the navigation bar includes a "Home" option, **When** the user clicks it from any other page, **Then** they are taken to the Home page with the introduction displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Browse Full Database Table (Priority: P2)

Users can browse the complete Sources table with controls for sorting columns, paginating through results, and filtering data to find specific records.

**Why this priority**: This provides access to the complete dataset with interactive controls that enable users to explore and find specific astronomical sources efficiently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to Browse Database page and verifying that all Sources are accessible through pagination, columns can be sorted, and filtering works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user navigates to the Browse Database page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a table displays all Sources records with columns for: source, ra, dec, epoch, equinox, shortname, reference, other_references, comments
2. **Given** the Sources table is displayed, **When** the user clicks on a column header, **Then** the table sorts by that column (ascending/descending toggle on repeated clicks)
3. **Given** the Sources table displays many rows, **When** the user views the page, **Then** pagination controls allow them to navigate through pages of results (e.g., 10, 25, 50, 100, or all rows per page)
4. **Given** the Browse Database page is loaded, **When** the user enters text in the global search box, **Then** the table updates to show only rows where any column contains the search text
5. **Given** the user changes pagination, sorting, or filtering, **When** the results update, **Then** the changes are applied within 1 second and the table refreshes smoothly

---

### User Story 4 - View Astronomical Data Plots (Priority: P2)

Users can view a scatter plot visualization of the Sources data showing the ra (right ascension) and dec (declination) coordinates to understand the spatial distribution of astronomical sources.

**Why this priority**: This provides a visual representation of the database that helps users understand the spatial distribution and relationships between astronomical sources in the sky.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the Plots page and verifying that an interactive scatter plot displays with ra on one axis and dec on the other axis using actual data from the Sources table.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user navigates to the Plots page, **When** the page loads, **Then** an interactive scatter plot displays with ra values on the horizontal axis and dec values on the vertical axis
2. **Given** the scatter plot is displayed, **When** the user hovers over data points, **Then** tooltips or labels show the source identifier and coordinate values
3. **Given** the scatter plot is displayed, **When** the user interacts with it (pan, zoom, reset), **Then** the visualization responds smoothly to user input
4. **Given** the Sources table contains data, **When** the Plots page loads, **Then** all Sources from the database are represented as points in the scatter plot

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a navigation link is clicked? The corresponding page loads and displays appropriate content via proper URL navigation (/browse, /plots, /)
- How does pagination handle when there are fewer records than the page size? Only the needed number of pages is shown
- What happens when filtering returns no results? A message is displayed indicating no records match the filter criteria
- How does sorting handle null or empty values? They are placed at the end (or beginning) of sorted results in a consistent manner
- What happens when the database connection fails on Browse Database or Plots? An error message is displayed indicating data is temporarily unavailable
- How does the scatter plot handle Sources with missing ra or dec values? Those records are excluded from the visualization with a note or legend indicating how many records were plotted
- What happens when the user clicks the currently active navigation item? The page content remains unchanged or the page refreshes to show the same content
- What happens when the user navigates away from Browse Database and returns? Sort, filter, and pagination state resets to defaults (all data visible, no sort/filter, first page)
- What happens if the Sources table has a very large number of records (approaching 10,000)? Client-side processing may become slower, but within acceptable range per assumptions

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a top navigation bar on all pages with three options: Home, Browse Database, and Plots

## Dependencies

- Existing web application structure from 001-hello-world-website and 002-display-sources-data
- SIMPLE.sqlite database with Sources table accessible
- FastAPI, Jinja2, Bokeh components already integrated
- Existing route structure and template system
- Static file serving infrastructure
- DataTables JavaScript library (CDN) for table controls (sorting, pagination, filtering)

## Assumptions

- Users want to navigate between three distinct pages rather than having all content on a single page
- The Home page should have a brief, concise introduction (2-3 paragraphs maximum)
- Pagination should default to 10-25 rows per page with options for larger page sizes
- Sorting, filtering, and pagination on Browse Database page are handled client-side using DataTables JavaScript library (all Sources data loaded once into browser memory)
- Filtering uses a single global search box that searches all columns simultaneously via DataTables
- The scatter plot should plot all available Sources with valid coordinates
- Users understand astronomical coordinate systems (ra and dec) at a basic level
- Existing header and footer content (from current index.html) will be maintained across all pages
- The navigation bar should appear consistently positioned at the top of all pages
- DataTables library will be loaded via CDN for simplicity (no npm/webpack required)

- Responsive mobile design optimization for navigation bar or tables
- Advanced filtering with multiple criteria or date ranges
- Export functionality for filtered/sorted data
- Multiple visualization types beyond the ra/dec scatter plot
- User authentication or page access controls
- Data editing or modification capabilities
- Server-side data processing optimizations beyond basic pagination
- Accessibility features beyond basic HTML/CSS (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)
- Performance optimization for datasets exceeding 10,000 records
- Bulk operations on table data
- Ability to customize visualization appearance or save custom views
