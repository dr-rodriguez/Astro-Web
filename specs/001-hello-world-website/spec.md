# Feature Specification: Hello World Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-hello-world-website`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Let's start by building a hello world website with this tech-stack. Let's avoid using a database for the moment, just focus on a simple website so we get the structure set up properly."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Hello World Page (Priority: P1)

A user navigates to the website in their browser and sees a simple welcome page with "Hello World" content. The page demonstrates basic functionality without requiring database access.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational user experience that validates the entire web stack is working correctly. Without this, no other functionality can be demonstrated.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the server, visiting the homepage in a browser, and verifying the page displays correctly. This delivers immediate value as a proof-of-concept for the technical architecture.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the web server is running, **When** a user opens the homepage in their browser, **Then** the page loads and displays "Hello World" content within 2 seconds
2. **Given** the homepage is loaded, **When** the user views the page, **Then** the styling (colors, layout, fonts) appears as intended
3. **Given** the web server is running, **When** a user navigates to a non-existent page, **Then** they receive a clear "not found" error message

### User Story 2 - View Simple Data Visualization (Priority: P2)

A user views a simple interactive data visualization embedded in the page that demonstrates Bokeh integration without requiring database access.

**Why this priority**: This validates the visualization stack is functional and demonstrates a key capability of the astronomical database platform. It provides immediate visual value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the page and interacting with the visualization (hover, zoom, pan if applicable). This delivers value by proving the visualization pipeline works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the homepage is loaded, **When** the user views the page, **Then** a simple data visualization is displayed and is interactive (responds to mouse hover)
2. **Given** the visualization is displayed, **When** the user hovers over data points, **Then** tooltips or legends appear showing relevant information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the server is stopped and user tries to access the page? The browser displays a connection error and provides clear feedback that the server is unavailable
- How does the system handle special characters in content? The page displays Unicode and special characters correctly without breaking layout
- What happens when user accesses the page from a slow network connection? The page loads progressively or shows a loading indicator for visualizations

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a web server that responds to HTTP requests on a specified port
- **FR-002**: System MUST render a homepage with "Hello World" content using HTML templates
- **FR-003**: System MUST apply CSS styling to create a visually appealing layout with colors, fonts, and spacing
- **FR-004**: System MUST display an interactive data visualization that responds to user mouse interactions
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle 404 errors gracefully with a user-friendly "not found" page
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize code in separate directories for routes, templates, static files, and visualizations
- **FR-007**: System MUST use hard-coded sample data for visualization without requiring database access
- **FR-008**: System MUST be startable with a single command that launches the web server

### Key Entities

- **Web Page**: Represents a single HTML page with header, content area, and footer sections
- **Visualization**: Represents an interactive data visualization component displaying sample astronomical or scientific data
- **Static Assets**: CSS files and other resources that are served without server-side processing

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view the homepage within 2 seconds of entering the URL
- **SC-002**: The page renders with correct styling and layout in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **SC-003**: The interactive visualization responds to mouse hover events within 100 milliseconds
- **SC-004**: The server starts and becomes accessible within 5 seconds of issuing the start command
- **SC-005**: All code is organized in the directory structure according to the project's technical guidelines
- **SC-006**: The web application demonstrates basic functionality without any database dependencies

## Dependencies

- Python 3.13+ runtime environment
- FastAPI framework installed and configured
- Jinja2 template engine for rendering web pages
- Bokeh library for generating interactive visualizations
- uvicorn server for running the FastAPI application
- Modern web browser for testing

## Assumptions

- Users have Python 3.13+ installed on their development machine
- The development server runs locally on a configurable port (default assumption)
- Browser JavaScript is enabled for interactive visualizations
- All required Python packages are listed in project dependencies
- The sample data for visualizations is hard-coded (no external data files required)
- CSS styling will be minimalist and focused on demonstrating basic layout principles
- No authentication or user accounts are required for this initial version

## Out of Scope

This feature explicitly does NOT include:

- Database connectivity or data persistence
- User authentication or login functionality
- Multiple pages or navigation between pages
- Server-side data processing or calculations
- API endpoints for external consumption
- Production deployment configuration
- Automated tests (testing will be manual)
- Responsive mobile design optimization
- Accessibility features beyond basic HTML semantics
- Error logging or monitoring infrastructure
- Docker containerization
