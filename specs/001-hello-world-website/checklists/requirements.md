# Specification Quality Checklist: Hello World Website

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [✅] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - PASS: Minimal mentions (FastAPI, Jinja2, Bokeh in Dependencies only as necessary constraints)
- [✅] Focused on user value and business needs - PASS: All requirements describe user-facing capabilities
- [✅] Written for non-technical stakeholders - PASS: Plain language throughout, no code or technical jargon
- [✅] All mandatory sections completed - PASS: All sections present and complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [✅] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - PASS: No markers found in specification
- [✅] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - PASS: All requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [✅] Success criteria are measurable - PASS: All criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds, 100ms, 5 seconds, browser types)
- [✅] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - PASS: Criteria focus on user experience and behavior, not technical implementation
- [✅] All acceptance scenarios are defined - PASS: Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios
- [✅] Edge cases are identified - PASS: Three edge cases documented (server down, special characters, slow network)
- [✅] Scope is clearly bounded - PASS: "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists excluded features
- [✅] Dependencies and assumptions identified - PASS: Dedicated sections for both

## Feature Readiness

- [✅] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - PASS: Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- [✅] User scenarios cover primary flows - PASS: P1 (homepage view) and P2 (visualization) cover essential functionality
- [✅] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - PASS: All SC items are directly supported by requirements and scenarios
- [✅] No implementation details leak into specification - PASS: No inappropriate technical details in user scenarios or requirements

## Notes

- ✅ **Validation Complete**: All checklist items passed
- ✅ **Specification Ready**: No clarifications needed
- ✅ **Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
